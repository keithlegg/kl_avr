Atmega128 - moody little bitch of a chip


----------------



YOU CAN HOOK UP A 1MHZ clock to XTAL 1 if you loose clock via bad fuses!!


---------------

CALIBRARION MODE?

sudo avrdude -c usbtiny -p ATmega128 -U calib:r:-:h

One fuse that every ATmega128 user will become familiar with very early on is the ATmega103 Compatibility Mode fuse.

All '128's come from the factory with this fuse pre-programmed. In that state, the chip will behave almost exactly as if it were actually an ATmega103 instead of an ATmega128.

Any software you write with the ATmega128 in in mind is 99% guaranteed to fail if you attempt to run it while the chip is in M103 compatibility mode... you'll have to at least modify that fuse.

In AVR Studio, it is easy to modify a single fuse without affecting any others... the fuse selection panel of the STK500/JTAGICE programming window automatically fetches the current fuse configuration as the window is being drawn, so that you can just click on the fuses that need to be modified and click Program.

With other programming software, things may not be as "safe". The problem is, in a "write" cycle, it is impossible to just modify a single fuse... the programming software has to specify the state of all of the High and Low fuse bits simultaneously, and all of the Extended fuse bits simultaneously. If the software you're using doesn't have foreknowledge of exactly what value should go into each individual bit (not just the one you've told it to modify), then you could accidentally render your AVR inoperable by doing something as apparently inoccuous as turning on the EEPSAVE fuse.

You'll be safer if you study the fuse bits carefully, and specifically decide on what fuse settings to use for each project you start, even if it turns out that you end up selecting the default set each time.

FYI, the ATmega128 has some special differences you need to be aware of. Using the ATmega128 Rev. 2467Wâ€“AVRâ€“05/11 data sheet as a reference:

First look at section SPI Serial Programming Pin Mapping Table 127. Pin Mapping SPI Serial Programming. In some AVRs like the ATmega128 the USART0 pins are used for the ISP function, and the SPI (do not confuse this with the ISP acronym) MOSI and MISO pins are not used. In lots of other AVRs the SPI pins MOSI and MISO are used for the ISP function.

Then look at sections ATmega103 and ATmega128 Compatibility and ATmega103 Compatibility Mode for the M103C fuse information. The ATmega128 is shipped from ATMEL with the M103C fuse programmed (see Table 117. Extended Fuse Byte). So, every brand new ATmega128 ships from the factory with the M103C fuse programmed making your new chip default into an ATmega103 (an old obsolete processor). If you purchased a circuit board with an ATmega128 already soldered onto the board, then the board manufacturer may have already unprogrammed the M103C fuse. You need to make sure the M103C fuse is unprogrammed if you really want a working ATmega128 chip.

Since you are new to AVRs I just thought you should be aware of these special ATmega128 differences. For example, if the M103C fuse is still programmed you could write perfectly good ATmega128 program code that will fail because the AVR is still in ATmega103 mode.
